## Idea

This is a web application designed for college students to make deep personal connections with their peers through mutual interests. The idea is similar to the popular social media platform Tinder: a user is introduced to other users through a matching system. Each person is given an option to either pass or match with another user in the database after he or she reviews a profile, which may consist of a profile picture, major, age, and a brief bio. Once a person wishes to match with someone, the other person may choose to reciprocate the match request, at which point a Connection is made, and the two users may begin messaging each other.


## Models and Description

There are 5 main models present in the app:

1. User

The user model has name, age, major, email, and login credentials through the devise gem.
Main associations for the user include: a user has many requests and connections. The user
is also self-joined to represent the mutual relationship between the user and other users
or matches.

2. Request

Requests have a user_id and requesting_id field and belong to user and match, which is an instance of user.

3. Messsage

The message model has a body, conversation_id, user_id, and a read field. Messages
belong to both a user and a conversation.

4. Conversation

A conversation has a sender_id and a recipient_id, and belongs to a sender and a
recipient. It also has a has many association with messages.

5. Connection

A connection belongs to a user and a match, which is a self-join of user. A connection
is created when a user accepts a request.
